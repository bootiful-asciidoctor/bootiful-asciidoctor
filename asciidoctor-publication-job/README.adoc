= Asciidoctor publication job

A Spring Batch `Job` that publishes technical books using Asciidoctor.

== Basic Implementation

This project represents a Spring Batch `Job` that has two major steps:

* the first `Step` loads all the pre-requisite Git repositories (concurrently).
As this may be an unknown quantity, we've specified that we should use an `ItemReader<T>` whose values are processed concurrently.
* the second `Step` invokes all the `DocumentProducer` instances (concurrently).
While we know that there are at most as many `Flow` instances as there are `DocumentProducer` instances, we don't know how many `DocumentProducer` steps there will be.
After all those are only registered if the user doesn't disable one of them by setting, e.g., `publication.mobi.enabled=false` (or `export PUBLICATION_MOBI_ENABLED=false`).
So, we use a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` to dynamically register the corresponding `Flow` instances.
But it works!
Register two `DocumementProducer` instances, and you'll see two concurrent `Flow` instances.

== To Do

* publish `ApplicationContextEvent` after each `DocumentProducer` is finished.
That way, information about the files produced could be communicated as an event.

== Getting Started

In theory, you can add this to any Spring Boot application.
You'll need to configure a few things.

.`application.properties`

----

<1> The first configuration value is the name of the book.
That's used a _ton_ so make sure to specify it.
<2> `pipeline.job.root` specifies where to clone all the Git repositories..
<3> `pipeline.job.target` specifies where to dump the tree of resulting artifacts after the document generation has completed
<4> The pipeline assumes that the documents for the book live in one Git repository...
<5> while the code to be used as includes in the book live in zero or more others.
